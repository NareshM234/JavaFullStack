java.util.Hashtable :-
******************
=> Hashtable is a sub class of Map.
=> Hashtable extends Dictionery, implements Map.
=> Hashtable allows key and value pairs.
=> Hashtable does not allow nullable key's as well as value's.
=> Hashtable allows duplicate values but does not allow duplicate key's.
=> Hashtable does not maintains the insertion Order.

java.util.Properties :-
*********************
=> Properties class is a subclass of Hashtable.
=> Properties class allows only the String type of key and value pairs.
=> Properties class does not allows generics.
=> Properties class does not allows nullble key and value pairs.
=> Properties class allows duplicate values but does not allows duplicate key's.
=> Properties class does not maintain insetion Order.


We can use all the methods of "java.util.Map" in " java.util.Properties" class

public void setProperty(String key,String value) : adds key and values pair to the Property.
public String getProperty(String key) : returns value based on key.

=> Using Properties class we can also get all the System properties.


Properties props = System.getProperties();


** using Properties class we can read the data from properties file.

The "java.util.Properties" class has given following method 
	
public void load(InputStream) throws IOException :- This is used to read the data from properties file.


** Procedure to develop an application which reads data from properties file.

	1. Create a Properties file and writes key and value pairs.

		dbinfo.properties 
		*****************
		username = srinu
		password = srinu123

	2. Develop a java program to read data from Properties file.
