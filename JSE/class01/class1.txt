Platform Dependent :-
*******************
	An executable block which can not be carried and executed in multiple 
	operating systems then that is called platform dependent.
	for : c, c++,cobol etc...

PlatForm Independent :-
*********************
	An executable block which can be carried and executed in multiple
	operating systems  by using an external software then that is called 
	Platform Independent.

	for : Java, .Net etc...
Refer Diagram :


When we compile a One.java program it will generate a "One.class" file.
The "One.class" file does not contains any instructions related to operating system.
The "One.class" file is in the form of byte code.

Byte Code :-
*********
Byte Code is a reusable code. Which can be converted into Machine laguage by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
Byte code does not contains any instructions related to operating system.

Java Virtual Machine (JVM) :-
**************************
JVM is a software given by Oracle . JVM can converts the byte code into Machine Language.
The is implemented using c,c++ language So that JVM is  plateform dependent.
The Oracle has given a seperate JVM for every operating System.
