Data Types :-
*********

	Data Types can be used declare a data member.
	Data Types can be classified based on Data.

		1. Numeric Data
			data types as : byte(1B),short(2B),int(4B),long(8B)

		2. Floating Data
			data types as : float(4B) , double(8B)
		
		3. String Data
			data type is :  String (Here memory is not fixed. Allocates the memory directly)

		4. Boolean Data 

			data type is : boolean (1B) => value either true or false.
		5. Charecter Data :

			data type is : char (1B)

	Ex: refer DataMembersEx.java

Conversion :-
**********

		It's a concept of converting one data type to another data type.

	Implicit Conversion :- Here the data type conversion automatically taken care by JVM.  
			Ex: byte => short => int => long 
				float => double
				char => byte
				

		int count = 10;
		long s = count ; // converting int to long .implicit conversio.


Explicit Conversion :- Here the programer has to take care of data type conversion . 

		refer ImplicitAndExplicitConversionEx.java


	In Explicit Conversion there is high possibility of LossyConversion(data loss), programer has to think about it.


		int count = 257;
		byte b = (byte) count;

		observe the value of b is 1 LossyConversion(data loss).

		refer LossyConversionEx.java

Finding Ascii value of every charecter:

		logic : convert char data type to byte.
