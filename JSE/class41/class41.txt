					IOStreams :-
					*********

Stream :- Stream is  a sequence of bytes.

IOStreams are used to communicate with Input and Ouput  devices.

All the IOStream classes are presented in "java.io" package .

The standard input and output streams given by java are 

	1.System.out
	2.System.in 
	3.System.error


java.io.InputStream  :-
********************
InputStream is an abstract class. The child classes of an InputStream can able read the data from Source. The Source can be File or Console or Socket.

=> public int read() throws IOException :- This method can be used to read the data from the input stream. If this method								 returns -1. Which indicates the end of the file.

=> public void close() throws IOException :- This method is used to close the Stream.

java.io.OutputStream :-
********************	
OutputStream is an abstract class. The child classes of the OutputStream can able write the data to the Destination. The Destination can be File or Console or Socket.

=> public void write(int) throws IOException :- This method can be used write a single byte to the output stream.

=> public void write(byte[]) throws IOException :- This method can be used write a array of bytes to the output stream.

=> public void flush() throws IOException :- This method moves the data from the stream to file. 

=> public void close() throws IOException :- This method is used to close the Stream.


We allready know that within the Stream the data can be transfered in the form of Sequence of bytes.

refer IOStreams,InputStream,OutputStream diagrams.


java.io.FileOutputStream :-
*************************
=> FileOutputStream is used to write the data to the file.

Constructor :-
**********
public FileOutputStream(String fileName) :- It will create the file with the specified name


FileInputStream :-
***************

=> FileInputStream is used to read the data from the file.

Constructor :-
**********
public FileInputStream(String fileName) :- It the file is not exist then it throws FileNotFoundException.


ByteArrayOutputStream :-
*********************
The ByteArrayOutputStream can be used to write into more than one file.

Constructor :-
**************
public ByteArrayOutputStream()

The ByteArrayOutputStream has "public void writeTo(OutputStream) throws IOException" method to write the data to the Stream.


SequenceInputStream :-
*******************
The SequenceInputStream can be used to read the data more than one file.

Constructor :-
**************
public SequenceInputStream(InputStream , InputStream) :- This is used to read data from from two files.
public SequenceInputStream(Enumeration) :- This is used to read data from  more than two files.

Understanding HighLevel Output and Input Streams :-
************************************************
1. BufferedOutputStream :- 
   ********************
	=> BufferedOutputStream  uses to write the data to the file.
	=> BufferedOutputStream internally uses the concept of buffer so that it increases the perfomance of the application.

	Constructor :-
	***********

public BufferedOutputStream(OutputStream) :- We create the BufferedOutputStream obejct by passing OutputStream object.

2. BufferedInputStream :- 
   ********************
	=> BufferedInputStream  used to read the data from the file.
	=> BufferedInputStream internally uses the concept of buffer so that it increases the perfomance of the application.

	Constructor :-
	***********

public BufferedInputStream (InputStream) :- We create the BufferedInputStream obejct by passing InputStream object.
