There are three kinds of applications.

1.Stand Alone Applications
2.WebApplications
3.Mobile Applications


Stand Alone Applications :-
***********************
An application which can be accessible only within the machine. Which can not be accessible outside the machine.
These applications can be called as Stand Alone Applications.

Ex:  VLC Media player,window media player, Google Chrome.

Within the Stand Alone Application's the data can not be sharable.

WebApplications :-
***************
An application through the web can be called as WebApplication.
Within the web application the data can be sharable.
All web applications gives 24/7 access.

Ex :- Gmail,Facebook etc..

Enterprice Application :-
***********************
Enterprice Application is a bussiness application which contains complex and heavy weight bussiness logics.

Ex: Flipkart , Amazon , Bank Applications etc..

Mobile Applications :-
********************
All the applications can be accessible within the mobile.

Ex : android , play store etc..

Java is devided into 3 parts.

1. Java Standard Edition (JSE)
2. Java Mobile Edition (JME)
3. Java Enterprice Edition (JEE)

Java Development Kit (JDK1.8) :-
*****************************
=> Java Development Kit(JDK) is software which is given by Oracle Corp inorder to develop java applications.
=> The Oracle corp has given separate JDK for every operating system.
=> The current JDK is 1.8.

The JDK is divided into two parts.

1.Java Tools

2.Java Runtime Environment(JRE)



Java Tools :- 
**********
Java Tools are used by the java programmer inorder to compile and run the java programe.
All the Java Tools are .exe files.

Ex: -

	javac  => This is used to compile java programe.
	java   => This is used to run the java programe.
	javap  => this is used to know the meta information about the java programe.

	etc.



Java Runtime Environment(JRE) :-
****************************
=> All the Java programes will be executed in Java Runtime Environment(JRE).
=> Whenever we are trying to run the java programe on the top of the operating system  JRE will be activated.
=> The JRE contains the implemetation for "Java Virtual Machine(JVM)" and Other Helper Files.
=> Once the JRE is activated the JVM will automatically activated.
=> JVM internally uses the Helper files of JRE to convert the Byte code into Machine Language.
